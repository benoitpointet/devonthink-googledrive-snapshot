# devonthink-googledrive-snapshot

This script downloads a snapshot of bookmarks of Google Drive assets in [Devonthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink).

## Why this script?
Google Suite is the environment I use at work, DT is my second brain. Sometimes I want to have a local copy of some document stored on the team drive. Thus the idea of generating snapshots.

## Installation

* Git-clone it, or [download it as a zip archive](https://github.com/benoitpointet/devonthink-googledrive-snapshot/archive/main.zip).
* This script requires the [RegexAndStuffLib (min v1.0.6)](https://latenightsw.com/support/freeware/) script to run.

## Usage
It currently allows to download **PDF snapshots** of **Google Docs, Spreadsheets and Presentations**.

### Login from within Devonthink
Login to Google Drive from within Devonthink before you intend to use it. For this simply open a Devonthink bookmark of some Google Drive document and login. Now you are ready to use it.  

### In a smart rule
You can trigger it from a smart rule, just don't forget to place it in the "Smart Rules" folder of the scripts folder (which you can open from the scripts menu).

### On selected item(s)
Select bookmark(s) to snapshot and run the script.
